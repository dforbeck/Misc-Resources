# Steps for Team Git

1. Move to your develop branch

2. Make sure your local develop is current with the remote develop

3. Create a new feature branch from develop locally

4. Work on whatever code you need to change/add/update etc.

5. Add and commit your changes regularly

6. Once the feature is finished and committed, push it to a new branch on the remote

7. Some one should do a pull request for the feature into the develop

8. Review and confirm the merge and delete the feature branch

9. Everyone on the team should now pull the changes to their local develop branch

### You should rinse-repeat steps 1-9 until your team feel confident that all changes made to the develop branch are worthy of being included into the master. 
### At that point you will repeat steps 7-9 but merging the develop into the master and updated all affected local branches.
